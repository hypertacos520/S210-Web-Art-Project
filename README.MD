This is my project for SOAD-S 210 Fall 2021. 

# Project Proposal:

For my Web Art project, I want to try and make a piece that shows how technology can prevent us from seeing what’s right in front of us. The main way I’m thinking of accomplishing this is by putting a screen of some kind (TV, smart phone, etc.) towards the center of the webpage with a lot of things you can interact with. These things could be different apps, changing a channel, etc. The screen will adapt as one would expect but the background will also react in some way. This could be something like fading from black to white or changing locations. The idea behind this is to show that the world is moving on even if the person using the device is still in their own world. I was inspired to make this by walking around campus and noticing how many different people weren’t looking up at where they were going or where they were.
